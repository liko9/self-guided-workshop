The purpose of todayâ€™s Hands-on Workshop was to introduce you to a world of ML-based experimentation for Kubernetes-based applications and to apply that knowledge specifically toward tuning Java applications in Kubernetes. Along the way we learned about several JVM tunables that can be leveraged (tons more to explore on your own) and how ML can help speed along the exploration and exploitation of these JVM tunables.

### Details

Please let us know how we did! Complete the workshop survey that will be emailed to the address used to register for this event to receive your *Credly* badge for *"ML-based App Tuning for Java"*. We hope to see you again in future workshops where we will cover other experiment areas with other types of applications!
