# MOD01 - Verifying Tools and Access

## Overview
In this module, we'll focus on installing the requisite CLI tools, cloning the workshop repo, and signing up for a StormForge Optimize trial account that we'll use to run our experiments.

## Lab
### Prerequisites
Verify that the following tools have been installed on the machine you intend to participate in the workshop with.
1. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
2. [stormforge CLI](https://docs.stormforge.io/optimize-pro/getting-started/install/#installing-the-stormforge-command-line-interface)
3. [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

### Clone the Workshop Repo
Once your prerequisite CLI tools have been installed on your machine, the first step will be to clone the workshop repo to a local directory.

`git clone https://github.com/thestormforge/self-guided-workshop.git`
