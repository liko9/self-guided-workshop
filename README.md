*Introduction*
[StormForge](https://www.stormforge.io) Hands-On-Workshops are a great way to get direct experience with our application optimization tools.

The StormForge Optimize platform uses machine learning to discover optimal application configurations via two methods:
* **Experimentation**: *StormForge Optimize Pro* employs an autonomous experimentation loop coupled with machine learning to optimize application configurations against load testing tools in a non-production environment. Optimal configurations along with parameter values can be explored and exported.
* **Observation**: *StormForge Optimize Live* analyzes metrics data from popular observability tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadog.com) to make recommendations on `cpu` & `memory` `requests` & `limits` values to each Kubernetes deployment in order to reduce overprovisioning and increase cluster efficiency. Recommendations can be implemented manually, automatically, or exported.
####Audience
* SRE's
* Platform Engineers
* Performance Engineers
* Application Developers

####What to expect
Each workshop consists of a sequence of modules designed to walk the audience through the deployment and optimization of various applications using either *Optimize Pro* or *Optimize Live* with an entire workshop intended to be completed in ~4-hours (half-day).
