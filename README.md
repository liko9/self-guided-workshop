####Introduction
The StormForge Optimize platform uses Machine Learning to discover optimal application configurations via two methods:
* **Experimentation**: StormForge Optimize Pro employs an autonomous experimentation loop coupled with machine learning to optimize application configurations against load testing tools in a non-production environment.
* **Observation**: StormForge Optimize Live integrates with popular metrics collection tools like Prometheus or Datadog to make recommendations on `cpu` & `memory` `requests` & `limits` values to reduce overprovisioning and increase cluster efficiency.
